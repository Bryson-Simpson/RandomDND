# C++ Practice Workspace

This workspace is set up for practicing C++ code. It includes a basic folder structure and a sample "Hello World" program.

## Structure
- `src/` - Source files
- `build/` - Build output
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Copilot instructions

## Build Instructions
To compile the sample program, run:

```
g++ src/main.cpp -o build/main
```

To execute:

```
./build/main
```

## Requirements
- g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)

Feel free to add more C++ files in the `src/` directory for practice.
