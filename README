# ðŸŽ² C++ Program to Generate a Random D&D Character

This C++ program generates a random Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) character using basic class structures and random number generation. It provides a foundation for players or Dungeon Masters (DMs) to quickly roll up a character with randomized stats, abilities, and more.

## âœ¨ Features

- Randomized ability score generation
- Expandable design for feats, skills, backgrounds, and other character traits
- Uses C++ `rand()` or can be upgraded to use `<random>` for more reliable randomness

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The program utilizes a class (`RandomNumAbilities`) to simulate D&D-style dice rolls. For example, to generate a random ability score between 1 and 20:

```cpp
int rollAbility() {
    return rand() % 20 + 1;
}
